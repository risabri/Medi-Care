# MediConnect Overview  

MedConnect is a mobile application that aims to create connections among people with similar medication schedules, while providing medication reminders and a platform for peer support. It is designed to address the problem of medication non-adherence, which affects both older adults and busy individuals who may forget to take their daily medication.

By leveraging the power of accountability, MedConnect encourages social support for medication adherence, which can lead to better overall health outcomes.


# How does this App function ?

Users would download the app and input
information about their medication schedules, including the times of
day they need to take medication, how many times per day they take
medication, and any special instructions for taking medication (e.g.
with food). The app would then match users with similar medication
schedules and provide a platform for peer support and medication
reminders.

MedConnect would provide several features to support medication
adherence, including medication reminders, a medication log to track
medication administration, and a messaging system to connect with
peers.


# Overall 
MediConnect is a promising proof of concept for an app that connects
older adults with similar medication schedules, providing a platform
for peer support and medication reminders. By focusing on the timing
of medication administration rather than specific medication
information.
