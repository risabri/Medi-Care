# Medi-Care
MedConnect is a mobile app designed to connect older adults with
similar medication schedules, providing a platform for peer support
and medication reminders. The app is intended to address the problem
of medication non-adherence in older adults, which can lead to
negative health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. By connecting
older adults with peers who have similar medication schedules,
MedConnect aims to increase social support for medication adherence
and improve overall health outcomes.
